    <h1>W3 Server Software</h1>
    <p>A W3 server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data</p>
    
    <h3>The basic daemon</h3>
<p>The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:</p>
    <li>User guide .</li>
    <li>Internals -- a description of the code.</li>
<p>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:</p>
<li>Tools for information providers</li>

<h3>Making a new server</h3>
<p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:</p>
<li>Writing a server in C</li>
<li>Writing a server as a script</li>
<p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.</p>
<h3>Other servers and Gateways</h3>
<p>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.</p>

<p>FIND gateway</p>
<p>for CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.</p>
<p>VMS Help gateway</p>
<p>This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.</p>
<p>WAISGate</p>
<p>A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.</p>
<p>DCLServer</p>
<p>A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite information system using DCL.</p>
<p>System33</p>
<p>A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...!</p>
<p>Oracle</p>
<p>A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific Oracle databases.</p>
<p>Geography</p>
<p>Gateway to the</p>
<p>Geography server at U Michigan</p>
